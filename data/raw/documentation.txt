      -- detailed description of data and measurement setup
      -- automated feature extraction via Pearson correlation and comparison of several classification algorithms
      -- Cooler and Valve states are "easy" targets (perfect classification achieved), Pump and especially Accumulator states are more complex targets

      -- sensor drift and offset can be compensated by the automatic feature extraction described in [1]
      -- faults of up to 5 sensors can be compensated for

      -- one of several example datasets for automatic feature extraction
      -- with ALA and RFESVM the error rate was reduced to 0.35 % (from 9.6 % in [1]) for the hydraulic accumulator state classification

4. Relevant Information:
   -- The data set was experimentally obtained with a hydraulic test rig. This test rig consists of a primary working and a secondary cooling-filtration circuit which are connected via the oil tank [1], [2]. The system cyclically repeats constant load cycles (duration 60 seconds) and measures process values such as pressures, volume flows and temperatures while the condition of four hydraulic components (cooler, valve, pump and accumulator) is quantitatively varied.

5. Number of Instances: 2205

6. Number of Attributes: 43680 (8x60 (1 Hz) + 2x600 (10 Hz) + 7x6000 (100 Hz))

7. Attribute Information:
   Attributes are sensor data (all numeric and continuous) from measurements taken at the same point in time, respectively, of a hydraulic test rig's working cycle.
   The sensors were read with different sampling rates, leading to different numbers of attributes per sensor despite they were all exposed to the same working cycle.
   
   1. Pressure sensors (PS1-6): 100 Hz, 6000 attributes per sensor (6 sensors)
   2. Motor power sensor (EPS1): 100 Hz, 6000 attributes per sensor (1 sensor)
   3. Volume flow sensors (FS1/2): 10 Hz, 600 attributes per sensor (2 sensors)
   4. Temperature sensors (TS1-4): 1 Hz, 60 attributes per sensor (4 sensors)
   5. Vibration sensor (VS1): 1 Hz, 60 attributes per sensor (1 sensor)
   6. Efficiency factor (SE): 1 Hz, 60 attributes per sensor (1 sensor)
   7. Virtual cooling efficiency sensor (CE): 1 Hz, 60 attributes per sensor (1 sensor)
   8. Virtual cooling power sensor (CP): 1 Hz, 60 attributes per sensor (1 sensor)

8. Missing Attribute Values: None

9. Class Distribution: there are 5 different class value vectors provided in profile.txt.
   All but number 5 (stable flag) describe degradation processes over time and, thus, their values do not represent distinct categories, but continuous values.

      3: close to total failure (732 instances)
      20: reduced effifiency (732 instances)
