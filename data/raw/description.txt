Condition monitoring of hydraulic systems
=========================================

Abtract: The data set addresses the condition assessment of a hydraulic test rig based on multi sensor data. Four fault types are superimposed with several severity grades impeding selective quantification.

Relevant Information:
The data set was experimentally obtained with a hydraulic test rig. This test rig consists of a primary working and a secondary cooling-filtration circuit which are connected via the oil tank [1], [2]. The system cyclically repeats constant load cycles (duration 60 seconds) and measures process values such as pressures, volume flows and temperatures while the condition of four hydraulic components (cooler, valve, pump and accumulator) is quantitatively varied. 

Attribute Information:
The data set contains raw process sensor data (i.e. without feature extraction) which are structured as matrices (tab-delimited) with the rows representing the cycles and the columns the data points within a cycle. The sensors involved are:
Sensor		Physical quantity		Unit		Sampling rate
PS1		Pressure			bar		100 Hz
PS2		Pressure			bar		100 Hz
PS3		Pressure			bar		100 Hz
PS4		Pressure			bar		100 Hz
PS5		Pressure			bar		100 Hz
PS6		Pressure			bar		100 Hz
EPS1		Motor power			W		100 Hz
FS1		Volume flow			l/min		10 Hz
FS2		Volume flow			l/min		10 Hz
TS1		Temperature			°C		1 Hz
TS2		Temperature			°C		1 Hz
TS3		Temperature			°C		1 Hz
TS4		Temperature			°C		1 Hz
VS1		Vibration			mm/s		1 Hz
CE		Cooling efficiency (virtual)	%		1 Hz
CP		Cooling power (virtual)		kW		1 Hz
SE		Efficiency factor		%		1 Hz

The target condition values are cycle-wise annotated in ‘profile.txt‘ (tab-delimited). As before, the row number represents the cycle number. The columns are

1: Cooler condition / %:
	3: close to total failure
	20: reduced effifiency
	100: full efficiency

2: Valve condition / %:
	100: optimal switching behavior
	90: small lag
	80: severe lag
	73: close to total failure

3: Internal pump leakage:
	0: no leakage
	1: weak leakage
	2: severe leakage

4: Hydraulic accumulator / bar:
	130: optimal pressure
	115: slightly reduced pressure
	100: severely reduced pressure
	90: close to total failure

5: stable flag:
	0: conditions were stable
	1: static conditions might not have been reached yet
